# ••• dotfiles •••

Host my development environment relying on Zsh, (Neo)Vim, Tmux, Ctags and Git.

To install locally the repository:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/damofthemoon/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Then complete the installation with the next commands:

```bash
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./install.sh
```

DON'T LAUNCH THE SCRIPT WITH SUDO! Sudo should be usefull only if you want to
install recommended applications like Git, Vim, ...
Enter for instance `sudo yum install` when the script prompt to enter
your package manager install command.
